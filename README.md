# 👋 Hey, I’m Srijan

I’m a **builder** that builds software - mostly infra, AI, or infra-AI stuff these days.

Been building since May 2016.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, Go, Bash, JavaScript
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Infra & Ops:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Flux, Docker 
- **Databases & Caches:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Memcached
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, VictoriaMetrics  

## 🛠️  LLM toolkit
- Claude Code with Opus 4.5 > codex || Cursor > everything else
- Trickery: Subagents, Clean and Precise context everytime, great MCPs

## 📌 Projects

### AI/LLM
- **[xray](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/xray)** → structural code intelligence for AI assistants using ast-grep.
- **[contextgraph](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/contextgraph)** → decision audit ledger for AI agents - captures "why" as queryable data.
- **[alpha](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/alpha)** → IAM policy rightsizing agent with AI-powered risk signals and instant rollback.
- **[claude-memory-viz](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/claude-memory-viz)** → memory visualization for Anthropic's Claude memory MCP.
- **[wiki-in-a-box](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/wiki-in-a-box)** → offline wikipedia with hybrid no‑index RAG - powered by gpt-oss:20b
- **[global-publish](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/global-publish)** → generates platform-native content for 12 platforms from a single source.

### Kubernetes/Infra
- **[kubectl-smart](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/kubectl-smart)** → turns noisy Kubernetes debugging into signal-first workflows.
- **[logsieve](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/logsieve)** → log deduplication sidecar using Drain3 algorithm, reduces volumes ~90%.
- **[scx-slo](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/scx-slo)** → eBPF CPU scheduler enforcing latency SLOs via Earliest Deadline First.
- **[softcron](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/softcron)** → Kubernetes CronJob controller with Prometheus gating, pacing, and jitter.
- **[cloud-bloom](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/cloud-bloom)** → self-replicating Terraform quine - Lambda that recursively spawns infrastructure.

### macOS
- **[murmur](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/murmur)** → live streaming voice-to-text using whisper.cpp with Metal acceleration.

## 🎤 Talks
- **[Slow down Disk I/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0gDoi63yRg)** → Flash talk on preventing `rm` from nuking SSDs, deep dive into `ionice`, `rsync`, and cgroups v2.  

---

## 🌱 A bit more
- Builder, heavy action-bias
- Co-founded a startup, led small teams, and still ship code. In another life.
