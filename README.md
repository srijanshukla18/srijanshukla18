# 👋 Hey, I’m Srijan

I’m a **builder** that builds software - mostly infra, AI, or infra-AI stuff these days.

Been building since May 2016.
I constantly aim to be at the cutting edge of tech.

- **[wiki-in-a-box](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/wiki-in-a-box)** → offline wikipedia with hybrid no‑index RAG - powered by gpt-oss:20b
- **[logsieve](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/logsieve)** → log deduplication sidecar using Drain3 algorithm, reduces volumes ~90%.
- **[scx-slo](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/scx-slo)** → eBPF CPU scheduler enforcing latency SLOs via Earliest Deadline First.
- **[softcron](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/softcron)** → Kubernetes CronJob controller with Prometheus gating, pacing, and jitter.
- **[murmur](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/murmur)** → live streaming voice-to-text for macOS using whisper.cpp with Metal acceleration.
- **[alpha](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/alpha)** → IAM policy rightsizing agent with AI-powered risk signals and instant rollback.
- **[contextgraph](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/contextgraph)** → decision audit ledger for AI agents - captures "why" as queryable data.
- **[global-publish](https://github.com/srijanshukla18/global-publish)** → generates platform-native content for 12 platforms from a single source.

## 🎤 Talks
- **[Slow down Disk I/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0gDoi63yRg)** → Flash talk on preventing `rm` from nuking SSDs, deep dive into `ionice`, `rsync`, and cgroups v2.

## 🌱 A bit more
- Builder, heavy action-bias
- Co-founded a startup, led small teams, and still ship code. In another life.
